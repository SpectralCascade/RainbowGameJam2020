RAINBOW GAME JAM 2020 - "STRENGTH IN NUMBERS"

IDEA:

    Top down game where you must gradually gather and guide a group of queer ghosts safely to the afterlife without being sucked up by the ghostbusters.
    Ghostbusters can suck up individual ghosts if you're not careful, but if you get enough together, you can scare them off by all shouting 'Boo!' at once,
    allowing safe passage.
